## Step 1: Warm up

It's time to get started! We will download our scaffolding project and make it up and running. 

```sh
$ curl -LOk https://our/path/to/pokedex.zip           // Download the Pokedex project
$ tar -zxvf pokedex.zip                               // Unzip the downloaded file
$ cd pokedex                                          // Change directory to the downloaded folder
$ git checkout -f step-1                              // Check out the first step
$ npm install                                         // Install all dependencies
$ npm start                                           // Start our server
```

Now, you should be able to visit http://localhost:3000 to see your beautiful Pokedex application, which looks like the following image:
