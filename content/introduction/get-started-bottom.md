## Step 01: Warm up

It's time to get started! Let's clone and initialise our project in order to get our development environment up and running.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/learnrelay/pokedex.git
cd pokedex
git checkout step-01
# copy and paste your endpoint from above to `package.json`
npm install
npm start  
# Open localhost:3000
```

Now, you should be able to visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your beautiful Pokedex application, which should look like this:
