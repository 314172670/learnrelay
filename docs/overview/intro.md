# Briefly introduction

> Talk about what's the reasons we want to do this "Learn Relay". How it's going to be different than others. **Try to structure your phases following "Why" > "How" > "What", people don't care what you do, they care why you do it.**

Welcome to this practical guide to Relay.
In less than one hour you will learn how to integrate Relay in your React applications.
Each chapter starts with a short video and contains an interactive example.
First we will cover the basics of GraphQL and then dive into using Relay. You will learn to query data and write mutations. We will also discuss the tools and setup you need for development with Relay.
So letâ€™s get started.
