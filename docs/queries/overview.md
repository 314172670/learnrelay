# Queries

In this chapter, we will learn [what a query is](what-is-a-query.md). You use queries to fetch data from the GraphQL server.

Whenever we want to send a query to our server in one of our React components, we have to wrap it with a [container](containers-fragments.md).
Usually you never write complete queries as above. Instead you are building them by combining [fragments](working-with-fragments.md).
Afterwards, we'll learn how to add additional flexibility using [query variables](variables.md).

By combining these parts, we will get familiar with our Pokedex app and prepare things for the following steps.
